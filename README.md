This was my first project within my CS 210 class at SNHU.
The project is to create an app the outputs the time in a 12-hour and 24-hour format.
Additionally, it requires a UI to let the user add an hour to the time, add a minute, second, or quit the application.
The clock did not need to display an accurate local time, and it did not need to run in real time.
This project needed to modularized within industry standard.
The purpose of this is to ensure that the code is secure, easily maintainable, and adjustable.
